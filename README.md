# CS3520-assignment

*challenges/problems*

*Design Process*
We used the given hints A0,A1,B0 and B1 that are given in the assignment for our inputs. A0 is used as the MSB on the first two bit number and B0 is the MSB of the other 2-bit number.
The standard truth table was used together with the common variables S0 as the sum generated from the first half adder, S1 is used to represent the sum from the second half adder. We aslo used the symbols C0 and C1 to mean/represent the carry outputs from the two half adders.
